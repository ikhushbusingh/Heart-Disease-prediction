Objective: Develop a predictive model using logistic regression to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient attributes and medical data.

Method: Preprocess the heart disease dataset, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. Implement logistic regression using Python and scikit-learn, train the model on the training data, and evaluate its performance on the testing data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Conclusion: The logistic regression model accurately predicts the probability of heart disease, providing valuable insights for early detection and prevention strategies in healthcare settings.
